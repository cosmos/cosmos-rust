Framework for building [Cosmos] blockchain applications in Rust, modeled off
of the [Cosmos SDK for Golang].

## About

This library is presently designed to serve as a *client* for interacting
with the Golang implementation of the Cosmos SDK, providing things like wallet
functionality such as transaction signing, and a builder/parser for Cosmos SDK
formatted transaction messages.

It does not implement server-side functionality (yet), such as hooks
and message passing.

## Features

- [CosmWasm]: messages used by smart contracts written using CosmWasm
- [Staking]: support for staking with validators
- [Transactions]: build, sign, and/or parse Cosmos SDK transactions

[Cosmos]: https://cosmos.network/
[Cosmos SDK for Golang]: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate is supported on Rust **1.63** or newer.
